//   Open the file in this js-practice repo in the bin folder named rps.js
//     - Write a script that looks at a variable representing either rock, paper,
//       or scissors, and picks a random one to pit it against.
//     - Log "Computer picked: <rock/paper/scissors>. You <win/lose>".
//     - _**Hint:** Try using Numbers to relate to user choices like using 0 to refer
//     to rock, 1 for paper, and 2 for scissors. Javascript includes a `random`
//     method within the `Math` built-in object to help you generate these numbers._
